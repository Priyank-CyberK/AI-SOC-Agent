# Real AI SOC Agent - Production Implementation

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a production-ready AI-powered Security Operations Center (SOC) agent that can:
- Monitor real network traffic using Snort/Zeek
- Analyze logs with machine learning models
- Interface with security tools (firewalls, SIEM)
- Make autonomous network configuration changes
- Provide real-time threat detection and response

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# System requirements
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or CentOS 8+
- 16GB+ RAM
- 4+ CPU cores
- 500GB+ storage
- Network access to monitored infrastructure
```

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-soc-agent
cd ai-soc-agent

# Setup environment
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Initialize ML models
python scripts/init_models.py

# Start monitoring
python main.py
```

## Configuration

### Network Monitoring Setup
1. Configure Snort/Zeek on network tap points
2. Setup log forwarding to AI agent
3. Configure firewall API access
4. Setup SIEM integration

### AI Model Training
1. Collect baseline network data (30+ days)
2. Label known threats and normal traffic
3. Train initial ML models
4. Deploy and start learning

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS**

1. **Network Segmentation**: Deploy in isolated security network
2. **Access Control**: Implement strict RBAC and API authentication
3. **Audit Logging**: Log all decisions and actions
4. **Fail-Safe**: Default to blocking unknown threats
5. **Human Oversight**: Require approval for critical actions

## Legal & Compliance

- Ensure compliance with local cybersecurity regulations
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Setup incident response procedures
- Document all automated actions for audit trails

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Single server deployment
- Simulated network traffic
- Local ML model training

### Production Environment
- Multi-server cluster
- High availability setup
- Real-time processing pipeline
- Distributed ML inference

## Monitoring & Alerting

- System health monitoring
- ML model performance tracking
- Response time metrics
- False positive/negative rates
- Integration status monitoring

## Next Steps

Alright, so you've got the basics covered! Now, what's next for this powerful AI SOC Agent? Think of it like a roadmap. Here's what we envision:

1.  **Phase 1: Laying the Foundation.** This is where we focus on setting up that basic monitoring infrastructure. You'll need to get the agent connected to your network taps, configure log forwarding, and make sure it's receiving the raw data it needs to do its job.
2.  **Phase 2: Bringing in the Brains.** Once the data is flowing, it's time to implement those crucial ML models and set up the training pipeline. This is where the system starts learning to identify threats. While some initial models might be included, you'll likely need to train them on your specific network traffic for optimal performance.
3.  **Phase 3: Empowering the Agent.** This phase is about adding those automated response capabilities. This is where the agent can start taking action based on its detections, like blocking an IP address through a firewall or updating a SIEM. **Remember the critical warning below – carefully test and approve these actions!**
4.  **Phase 4: Going Live (Carefully!).** After rigorous testing in a controlled environment, this is the phase for deploying the agent in your actual production environment. Follow the guidelines in `DEPLOYMENT.md` closely for this crucial step.
5.  **Phase 5: Staying Sharp.** Cybersecurity is constantly evolving. This final phase represents the ongoing process of continuous improvement and updating the ML models. It's about keeping the agent effective against new and emerging threats.

**⚠️ WARNING**: This system can make autonomous changes to network infrastructure. Ensure proper testing, approval processes, and safety mechanisms before production deployment.
